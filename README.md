# CertifyO Internship Tasks

This repository contains the completed tasks during my **Frontend Development Internship at CertifyO**. Each task is structured clearly in its own folder and reflects progressive learning and implementation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## 🚀 Running the Projects Locally

git clone https://github.com/ShashankKan0jia/CertifyO-internship.git
cd CertifyO-internship
```

2. **Run HTML/CSS Projects (Task 1 & 2)**  
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. **Run React Projects (Task 3 & 4)**  
   Navigate to the specific project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd Task3(my-todo-app)   # or Task4(weather-app)
npm install

## 📦 External Libraries & Tools Used

| Task      | Libraries/Tools            |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Task 3    | React, Create React App     |
| Task 4    | React, Axios, OpenWeather API |

---

## ⚙️ Key Design/Implementation Notes

- React apps were bootstrapped with **Create React App** for fast setup.
- Components were separated to improve **readability** and **scalability**.
- The To-Do app uses `useState` for local state management and basic CRUD operations.
- The Weather app uses **Axios** for API calls and handles errors gracefully.
- Tasks 1 & 2 follow **semantic HTML** and are fully **responsive** with CSS.

> 📌 Note: Some folder names contain parentheses for clarity (e.g., `Task3(my-todo-app)`), though it's generally advised to avoid them in production folders for better cross-platform compatibility.
