# CertifyO Internship Projects

This repository showcases a series of front-end development tasks completed during my internship at CertifyO. The projects demonstrate increasing complexity and focus on core web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## üìå Overview

The repository includes the following tasks:

### Task 1
Basic webpage using HTML and CSS. Focused on learning semantic HTML and foundational CSS properties for layout and styling.

### Task 2
Responsive design project that utilized Flexbox and media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. Demonstrates an understanding of modern CSS layout techniques.

### Task 3: My To-Do App
A dynamic to-do list application built with JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also uses local storage to persist data between sessions.

### Task 4
[Description pending ‚Äî replace this with actual task details if available.]

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Projects Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShashankKan0jia/CertifyO-internship.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd CertifyO-internship
   ```

3. **Open the Task in a Browser**
   ```bash
   cd "Task 3 (my-todo-app)"  # Example
   start index.html  # Windows
   open index.html   # macOS
   xdg-open index.html  # Linux
   ```

## üß∞ External Libraries and Tools

This project primarily uses vanilla technologies. However, some tasks may incorporate:

- **Google Fonts** ‚Äì For custom typography.
- **Font Awesome / Icons (if any)** ‚Äì For UI icons.
- **Local Storage API** ‚Äì For saving user tasks persistently in Task 3.

No frameworks or build tools (like React or Webpack) were used, keeping the implementation lightweight and beginner-friendly.

## üß† Design and Implementation Choices

- **Vanilla JavaScript:** The decision to use pure JS without frameworks was intentional to strengthen fundamentals and maintain full control over the DOM.
- **Local Storage for Persistence:** Rather than implementing a backend or using a database, the To-Do App in Task 3 uses the browser‚Äôs local storage for simplicity.
- **Responsive Design:** Emphasis on Flexbox and CSS Grid rather than relying on libraries like Bootstrap to better understand layout behavior.
- **Modular Folder Structure:** Each task is kept in a separate folder to promote clarity and modular development.

These design decisions were made to adhere to best practices while reinforcing core concepts of front-end development.
